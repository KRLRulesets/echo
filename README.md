Simple ruleset to show how the Event protocol works. Used by the demo script in [windley/Raise.pm](https://github.com/windley/Raise.pm). 

Install this in your SquareTag or CloudOS account using KDK. 

This ruleset is described in detail in the [Echo Server recipe](http://developer.kynetx.com/display/docs/Creating+an+Echo+Server).
